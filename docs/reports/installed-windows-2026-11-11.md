# Installed Windows application validation · 11 November 2026

By Jason Stys. This report records actual published **1.1.0** installed bytes from `4ba77538f5d3025677c51dc3948c1870d2aff963`. Earlier Office editions retain their historical baselines and bytes.

## Observed results

The installed three-phase consumer verified actual play/timer inputs, replay/export, exact authored-scene restart and preserved corrupt-profile recovery.

All required main workflows for the runtime revision passed; processed CodeQL analyses reported zero open main alerts before release.

All 2 assets matched provider/checksum identities; all 6 installed files remained unchanged during acceptance.

New per-user version folder and individual links verified. Synthetic profiles only; existing data and Docker were not used or changed.

## Illustrated user workflow and implementation

The [four-page guide](windows-application-guide-1.1.0.docx) contains two actual installed-application screenshots, a worked user journey, important immutable-source code excerpts, validation observations and practical limits. Every final page content was individually inspected and the OOXML schema passed. The [review manifest](windows-application-guide-1.1.0.json) binds the Word, screenshot, source and rendered-page identities. Prepared examples are inputs to the full application, never separate demo apps.

## Installation, data and limits

Keep the complete extracted ZIP together and launch Forge2DEditor.exe. No system runtime or terminal setup is needed.

Open the verified Desktop icon. Help describes supported inputs and workflow limits; close through the app's owner controls and back up its external data directory after a normal exit.

Unsigned Windows portable app; not an OS installer, signing proof or clean-machine certification. Only marked synthetic profiles and actual own-window handlers/timers tested; no normal AppData, populated-user upgrade or external OS input automation.

Prepared inputs and acceptance used synthetic data only; normal profiles were not opened and Docker was unchanged. Local plaintext is trusted-OS-owner data, not protection against that OS user or administrator.

Desktop and Start-menu link targets were verified. The full installed-executable acceptance is distinct from normal shortcut activation; no additional manual shortcut-button test is claimed. Existing accounts and Docker were unchanged. This documentation revision must pass its own complete hosted checks; earlier runtime results do not certify future source changes.
